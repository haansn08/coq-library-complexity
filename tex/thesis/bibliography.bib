abstract="A large class of computational problems involve the determination of properties of graphs, digraphs, integers, arrays of integers, finite families of finite sets, boolean formulas and elements of other countable domains. Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

abstract="As is the case with many theorems in complexity theory, typical proofs of the celebrated Cook-Levin theorem showing the NP-completeness of satisfiability are based on a clever construction. The Cook-Levin theorem is proved by carefully translating a possible computation of a Turing machine into a boolean expression. As the boolean expression is built, it is ``obvious'' that it can be satisfied if and only if the computation corresponds to a valid and accepting computation of the Turing machine. The details of the argument that the translation works as advertised are usually glossed over; it is the translation itself that is discussed. In this paper, we present a formal proof of the correctness of the translation. The proof is verified with the theorem prover ACL2.",

The proof is done at an abstract, machine independent level, and is particularly aimed to identify the minimal set of assumptions required to prove the result (smaller than expected, actually). The work is part of a long term reverse complexity program, whose goal is to obtain, via a reverse methodological approach, a formal treatment of Complexity Theory at a comfortable level of abstraction and logical rigor.",
