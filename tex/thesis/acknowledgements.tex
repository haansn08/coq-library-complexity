Most importantly, I would like to thank Fabian for many fruitful discussions and ideas as well as the support he provided in our weekly meetings throughout the semester. I appreciate the valuable feedback he gave on various parts of this thesis. 

I am very grateful to Professor Smolka for introducing me to computational logic and Coq through his ICL course and for allowing me to write this thesis at his chair. Moreover, I am thankful that he mentored and supported me for the past two years of my Bachelor's studies. 

I am greatly indebted to my family for supporting me both emotionally and financially. Without them, neither I nor this thesis would exist. 
Additionally, I want to express my gratitude towards my friends for the time we spent together and for providing some distraction from work. Especially, I would like to thank Marcel and Timon for proof-reading this thesis. 

Finally, I want to express my gratitude towards Yannick Forster for providing the \LaTeX{} template for this thesis and Professor Bl√§ser as well as Professor Smolka for reviewing it.
