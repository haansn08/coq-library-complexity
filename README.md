# A library of formalised undecidable problems in Coq

This library contains undecidable problems and formalised reductions between them.
Feel free to contribute or start using the problems!

## Existing undecidable problems

- Post correspondence problem (`PCP` in [`Problems/PCP.v`](theories/Problems/PCP.v))
- Halting problems for single-tape and multi-tape Turing machines (`Halt` in [`Problems/TM.v`](theories/Problems/TM.v)
- Halting problem for Minsky machines (`MM_HALTING` in [`Problems/MM.v`](theories/Problems/MM.v))
- Halting problem for two counters Minsky machines (`MM2_HALTING` in [`Problems/MM2.v`](Problems/MM2.v)) with 
  self-contained explanations
- Halting problem for Binary Stack Machines (`BSM_HALTING` in [`Problems/BSM.v`](theories/Problems/BSM.v))
- Halting problem for the call-by-value lambda-calculus (`eva` in [`Problems/L.v`](theories/Problems/L.v))
- String rewriting (`SR` in [`Problems/SR.v`](theories/Problems/SR.v))
- Entailment in Elementary Intuitionistic Linear Logic (`EILL_PROVABILITY` in [`Problems/ILL.v`](theories/Problems/ILL.v))
- Entailment in Intuitionistic Linear Logic (`ILL_PROVABILITY` in [`Problems/ILL.v`](theories/Problems/ILL.v))
- Provability in Minimal (Intuitionistic, Classical) First-Order Logic (`prv` in [`Problems/FOL.v`](theories/Problems/FOL.v))
- Validity in Minimal (Intuitionistic, Classical) First-Order Logic (`valid` in [`Problems/FOL.v`](theories/Problems/FOL.v), `kvalid` in [`Problems/FOL.v`](theories/Problems/FOL.v))
- Satisfiability in Intuitionistic (Classical) First-Order Logic (`satis` in [`Problems/FOL.v`](theories/Problems/FOL.v), `ksatis` in [`Problems/FOL.v`](theories/Problems/FOL.v))
- Halting problem for FRACTRAN programs (`FRACTRAN_REG_HALTING` in [`Problems/FRACTRAN.v`](theories/Problems/FRACTRAN.v))
- Satisfiability for elementary diophantine constraints (`DIO_ELEM_SAT` 
  in [`Problems/DIOPHANTINE.v`](theories/Problems/DIOPHANTINE.v))
- [Hilbert's 10th problem](https://uds-psl.github.io/H10), i.e. solvability of a single diophantine equation (`H10` in 
  in [`Problems/DIOPHANTINE.v`](theories/Problems/DIOPHANTINE.v))
- Satisfiability of elementary Diophantine constraints of the form `x=1`, `x=y+z` or `x=y.z` without parameters (`H10C_SAT` in [`Problems/H10C.v`](theories/Problems/H10C.v))

## How to build

### Required packages

You need `Coq 8.8.1` or `8.8.2` built on OCAML `> 4.02.3` and the [Equations](https://mattam82.github.io/Coq-Equations/) package for Coq. If you're using opam 2 you can use the following commands to install the dependencies on a new switch:

```
opam switch create coq-library-undecidability 4.07.1+flambda
eval $(opam env)
opam install . --deps-only
```

### Build external libraries

The Undecidability libraries depends on several external libraries. Initialise and build them once as follows:

``` sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
make deps
```

### Building the undecidability library

- `make all` builds the library
- `make html` generates clickable coqdoc `.html` in the `website` subdirectory
- `make clean` removes all build files in `theories` and `.html` files in the `website` directory
- `make realclean` also removes all build files in the `external` directory. You have to run `make deps` again after this.
