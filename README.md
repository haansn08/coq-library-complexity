# The Coq Library of Complexity Theory
![build](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-complexity/workflows/build/badge.svg)

This library contains complexity theory. It is build upon the [Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability).

## How to build




<!---### Install from opam

Install the [A Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability), then install this.
--->
### Building from source

First, make sure you checked out this git, including submodules, for example via:

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:uds-psl/coq-library-complexity.git
```

Then, the [Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs](https://github.com/uds-psl/coq-library-undecidability)is included as a submodule in `./coq-library-undecidability`.

- `make all` builds the library and the dependencies
- `make deps` builds the dependencies by itself 
- `make html` generates clickable coqdoc `.html` in the `website` subdirectory
- `make clean` removes all build files in `theories` and `.html` files in the `website` directory
- `make realclean` removes the build files of the dependencies as well as everything `make clean` removes

### Troubleshooting

#### Coq version

Be careful that this branch only compiles under Coq 8.12.

## Published work and technical reports

### Related Papers and abstracts from the Coq Library of Undecidability Proofs

We make heavy use of the following results, which for technical reasons are oursourced to the Library of Undecidability Proofs.

We use two Frameworks they ease resource analysis and computability proofs for call-by-value lambda-calculus and Turing machines:
  + A certifying extraction with time bounds from Coq to call-by-value lambda-calculus. ITP '19. Subdirectory `L`. https://github.com/uds-psl/certifying-extraction-with-time-bounds

TODO: tidy up following, add POPL paper
